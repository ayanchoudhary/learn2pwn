# Introduction to pwning (learn2pwn)
> A repository for teaching pwning concepts


Best friends of a pwner:
1. Disassembler(Ghidra, IDA, Hopper, etc.)
1. Debugger(GDB, WinDBG, OllyDBG, etc.)

You can explore/use more of these but even learning one will suffice in most cases :)

## Disassembler
1. Assembly


## Debugger
1. ptrace, strace


## Environment setup:

1. Setup the following tools(recommended), since I will be using these during the lectures:
	- [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
	- [gdb+gef](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/02-intro_tooling/gdb-gef/index.html)

1. Install python and pwntools


### Environment setup for 64-bit users:

Follow this [guide](https://askubuntu.com/questions/454253/how-to-run-32-bit-app-in-ubuntu-64-bit) to add i386 architecture support to your system and then your system will be able to run most of the binaries.
